1.  Introduction

   Load balancing is a critical aspect of network design, enabling
   efficient utilization of available bandwidth and improving overall
   network performance.  Traditional equal-cost multi-path (ECMP)
   routing does not account for the varying capacities of different
   paths.  This document suggests that the external link bandwidth be
   carried in the network using one of two new extended communities
   [RFC4360] - the transitive and non-transitive link bandwidth extended
   community.  The Link Bandwidth Extended Community provides a
   mechanism for routers to advertise the bandwidth of their downstream
   path(s), facilitating maximum utilisation of network resources.

2.  Link Bandwidth Extended Community

   The Link Bandwidth Extended Communities are defined as a BGP extended
   community that carries the bandwidth information of a router,
   represented by BGP Protocol Next Hop, connecting to remote network.
   This community can be used to inform other routers about the
   available bandwidth on trough a given route.

   The Link bandwidth extended communities can be either transitive or
   non-transitive.  Therefore the value of the high-order octet of the
   extended Type Field cab be 0x00 or 0x40 respectively.  The value of
   the low-order octet of the extended type field for this communities
   is 0x04.  The value of the Global Administrator subfield in the Value
   Field SHOULD represent the Autonomous System of the router that
   attaches the Link Bandwidth Community, but in can be set to any
   2-byte value.  If four octet AS numbering scheme is used [RFC6793],
   AS_TRANS should be used in the Global Administrator subfield.  The
   bandwidth of the link is expressed as 4 octets in [IEEE.754-2019]
   floating point format, units being bytes (not bits!) per second.  It
   is carried in the Local Administrator subfield of the Value Field.

    Type:   1-octet field MUST be set to 0x00 or 0x40
            to indicate transitive/non-transitive.

    SubType: 1-octet field MUST be set to 0x04
             to indicate 'Link-Bandwidth'.

    Global Administrator sub-field:
             2-octet represent the Autonomous System.

    Local Administrator sub-field:
             Bandwidth value (bytes per sec) encoded as 4 octets
             in IEEE floating point format.

Internet-Draft    BGP Link Bandwidth Extended Community   September 2024


3.1.  Sender (Originating Link Bandwidth Community)

   An originator of the link bandwidth community SHOULD be able to
   originate either a transitive or a non-transitive link bandwidth
   extended community.  Implementation SHOULD provide configuration to
   set the transitivity type of the link bandwidth community, as well as
   Global Administrator filed value and bandwidth value in (Local
   Administrator filed), trough local policy.  No more than one link
   bandwidth extended community SHALL be attached to a route.

   An originator can attach link bandwidth community to BGP path in
   egress processing to adj-RIB-out only or in ingress processing in
   which case link bandwidth community is present in Local-RIB.

   Note: Implementation MAY provide configuration option (knob) to allow
   sending non-transitive link bandwidth extended community on external
   BGP sessions.

3.2.  Receiver (Receiving link bandwidth community)

   A BGP receiver MUST be able to process link bandwidth community of
   both transitive or non-transitive type.  The receiver MUST NOT flap
   or treat the route as malformed based on the transitivity of the link
   bandwidth community and/or BGP session type (internal vs.  external).

   Note: Implementation MAY provide configuration option (knob) to
   accept non-transitive link bandwidth extended community from external
   BGP sessions.

3.3.  Re-advertisement Procedures

3.3.1.  Re-advertisement with Next hop Self

   When a BGP speaker re-advertises a route with the Link Bandwidth
   Extended Community and sets the next hop to itself, it SHOULD follow
   the same procedures as outlined in Section 3.1.

   In the absence of any import or export policies that alter the Link
   Bandwidth Extended Community, any received Link Bandwidth extended
   community on the route will be re-advertised unchanged, in accordance
   with standard BGP procedures.

3.3.2.  Re-advertisement with Next Hop Unchanged

   A BGP speaker that receives a route with link bandwidth community,
   re-advertises or reflects the same without changing its next hop
   SHOULD NOT change the link bandwidth extended community in any way.

3.4.  Link bandwidth community Arithmetic and BGP multipath

   In a BGP multipath ECMP environment, the value of the link bandwidth
   community that is sent or re-advertised may be calculated based on
   the link bandwidth communities of the routes contributing to
   multipath in the Local Routing Information Base (Local-RIB).  This
   topic is beyond the scope of this document.

4.  Error Handling

   If a receiver receives a route with more than one Link Bandwidth
   Extended Community, it SHOULD:

      Prefer the lowest value of the attached link bandwidth community
      (Irrespective of the transitivity)

      Prefer the transitive Link Bandwidth Extended Community when
      choosing between transitive and non-transitive types that have the
      same value

   Implementations MAY provide configuration options (knobs) to change
   the above preference.

5.  Document History

   The BGP Link Bandwidth Extended Community has evolved over several
   versions of the IETF draft.  In the earlier versions up to draft-
   ietf-idr-link-bandwidth-08, only the non-transitive version of the
   link bandwidth extended community was supported.  However, starting
   from draft-ietf-idr-link-bandwidth-09, both transitive and non-
   transitive versions of the link bandwidth extended community are
   supported.

   An old sender/receiver is a BGP speakers either use procedures upto
   draft (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-idr-link-
   bandwidth-08) or any undocumented behavior for link bandwidth
   extended community.

   A new sender/receiver is a BGP speaker that implements procedures
   specified in this document.

   Receiving speaker needs to be upgraded to support the procedures
   defined in this document to provide full interop with both transitive
   and non-transitive versions of LBW.  In order to keep changes to
   procedures simple, it is not a goal to provide interop between old
   Receiver and new Sender.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a specific application of the two-octet AS
   specific extended community.  IANA is requested to assign a sub- type
   value of 0x04 for the link bandwidth extended community.

       Name                                           Value
       ----                                           -----
       non-transitive Link Bandwidth Ext. Community  0x4004

       Name                                           Value
       ----                                           -----
       transitive Link Bandwidth Ext. Community       0x0004

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security risks introduced by this design.
